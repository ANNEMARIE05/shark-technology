Artificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity: it enables real-time threat detection, automated incident response, and anticipation of attacks. But it can also be used by malicious actors to design more sophisticated attacks.

In this article, we explore both sides: how AI strengthens defense (anomaly detection, log analysis, orchestration) and what new risks it introduces (deepfakes, automated phishing, control evasion). We provide concrete steps to integrate AI into your security strategy while staying vigilant.

CompTIA Security+, CISSP, CCNA, Linux LPIC-1 and CEH remain among the most valued certifications by employers in 2026. We detail for each: target audience, cost, validity period and typical roles they lead to.

Whether you're a beginner or already in the field, a well-chosen certification can accelerate your growth. We help you prioritize based on your profile and goals (network, security, cloud, operations).

A successful cloud deployment relies on security by design: identity and access (IAM), encryption of data at rest and in transit, network segmentation and centralized logging. We review an operational checklist applicable to AWS, Azure and GCP.

We also cover compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001) and common pitfalls (overly open default configurations, exposed keys, lack of rotation policy). Simple best practices can drastically reduce the attack surface.

Pentesting (penetration testing) aims to identify vulnerabilities before an attacker exploits them. We present the classic phases: reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation and reporting. Each phase is illustrated with common tools (Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit) in a legal and ethical framework.

We stress the importance of a defined scope and written authorization, as well as writing an actionable report for technical teams and management. Ideal for a first approach before in-depth training (e.g. Ethical Hacking certification).
